# React Debug Exercise

The code in this app is intentionally broken. In my own journey as a web developer, I've found that debugging is not only a valuable skill but also a great way to learn.

This app was created to help co-workers learn React. It provides an alternative to the traditional method of creating a todo app from scratch.

### Before You Start

You should be able to progress past the sign in form when the code is fixed. Any test login credentials will work (the app has no back end authentication or form validation beyond what's native to the browser). The main view looks like the screenshot below:

<p align='center'>
  <img src='./src/assets/main_view.png' width='750' height='500' />
</p>

The SAR method (Situation, Action, Result) is a great method for thinking through the steps needed to solve a problem. For a written bug report, I use the SEA template (Steps to reproduce, Expected result, Actual result).

This app includes a lint tool, so many errors will display in the Terminal app (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows). The JavaScript console in the developer tools menu of any modern browser should also provide assistance.

Traditional methods for [debugging Javascript](https://medium.com/@sandeep.scet/different-ways-to-debug-javascript-code-579e7f58cf10#.3gbqsze60) won't always work in a React application because React code isn't native to the browser. [React Dev Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) might be more helpful. The hierarchy and nesting of components is highly visible in React Dev Tools, which makes debugging easier because an element's location in the actual code is easier to find.

### Installation

1.  Check that Node and NPM are installed. Run `node -v` and then `npm -v` from the command line (Windows) or Terminal app (Mac). If a version number does not print to the console, follow [Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac) or [Windows](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) installation instructions.

2.  Clone the repository, install dependencies, then start the development server (from the command line or Terminal app):

  ```
    > git clone git@github.com:kristingreenslit/react-debug-exercise.git
    > cd react-debug-exercise
    > npm install
    > npm start
  ```

3.  Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser of choice. Note: Running `npm start` and entering the keyboard shortcut `CTRL + C` from the project's root directory will start and stop the server.

### Debugging Tips for Teams

* Save the SEA template mentioned above (Steps to reproduce, Expected result, Actual result) as a signature in your email client (such as [Outlook](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-add-a-signature-to-messages-8ee5d4f4-68fd-464a-a1c1-0e1c80bb27f2)) if you find yourself frequently reporting bugs.

* Slack integrates with [GitHub](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/232289568-Use-GitHub-with-Slack), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/slack.html) and even [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin) to automatically notify channels about events such as commits, builds and pull requests.

* JIRA can be configured to [automatically generate](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/creating-issues-and-comments-from-email-779288896.html) issues, comments and help desk requests.

### Additional Notes

React is an incredibly powerful JavaScript library, but it's easier to learn when you have a solid foundation in [HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/), [CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics). An HTML/CSS/JavaScript pur√©e, [JSX](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/jsx-looks-like-an-abomination-1c1ec351a918#.ro3sx1ea0), is an industry standard in React applications (although it is not required).

[Redux](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-router/) and [React-Router](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/) are frequently used in React applications. The simple explanation is that React, a library used for building [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (Single Page Applications), is one big magic trick. It breaks the mold of how traditional websites operate by rendering components on the client side when needed vs. rendering content from a server. However, React is the view layer in the traditional "MVC" architecture. The use of additional libraries with React, such as Redux and React-Router, can enhance React code so that it functions like a [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework) and the flow of data throughout an application is more accessible, organized and/or traceable.

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used to bootstrap this project.
