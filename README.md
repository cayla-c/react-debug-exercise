# React Debug Exercise

The intention of this app is to help co-workers learn React.

In my own journey as a web developer, I've noticed that debugging is not only a valuable skill but one of the best ways to learn. Therefore, the code is this app is intentionally broken.

### Before You Start

Learing

### Installation

1. Check that Node and NPM are installed. Run *node -v* and then *npm -v* from the command line (Windows) or Terminal app (Mac). If a version number does not print to the console, follow these instructions:

[Mac users] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
[Windows users] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)

1. From the command line or Terminal: clone the repository, install dependencies, then start the development server:

```
  > git clone git@github.com:kristingreenslit/react-debug-exercise.git
  > cd react-debug-exercise
  > npm install
  > npm start
```

1. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your web browser of choice. Note: Running **npm start** and entering the keyboard shortcut **CTRL + C** from the project's root directory will start and stop the server


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
