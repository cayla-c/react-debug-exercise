# React Debug Exercise

The code in this app is intentionally broken.

In my own journey as a web developer, I've noticed that debugging is not only a valuable skill but also a great way to learn. This exercise was created to help co-workers learn React by providing an alternative to the traditional "todo app" tutorial.

### Before You Start

React is an incredibly powerful JavaScript library, but it's easier to learn when you have a solid foundation in [HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/), [CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics). 

[Traditional methods for debugging Javascript](https://medium.com/@sandeep.scet/different-ways-to-debug-javascript-code-579e7f58cf10#.3gbqsze60) won't always work well in a React application. [Developer tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) might be more helpful.

### Installation

1. Check that Node and NPM are installed. Run *node -v* and then *npm -v* from the command line (Windows) or Terminal app (Mac). If a version number does not print to the console, follow instructions for [Mac] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac) or [Windows] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) users.

2. From the command line or Terminal: clone the repository, install dependencies, then start the development server:

  ```
    > git clone git@github.com:kristingreenslit/react-debug-exercise.git
    > cd react-debug-exercise
    > npm install
    > npm start
  ```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your web browser of choice. Note: Running **npm start** and entering the keyboard shortcut **CTRL + C** from the project's root directory will start and stop the server
